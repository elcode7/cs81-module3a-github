 While working on this project, I learned how Git and GitHub work together to manage and track code changes. I learned how to clone repositories, make commits, push changes, and view my commit history. The most confusing part at first was understanding the difference between my local repository and the remote repository on GitHub. It was also frustrating when I forgot to commit changes before pushing or when Git told me there was nothing to push.
I think developers use Git because it helps them keep track of changes, avoid losing work, and collaborate with others safely. Git allows developers to experiment without breaking the main code, and GitHub makes it easy.
